# AI mobile robots with reactive behaviour and human detection, object avoidance

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Python program for controlling mobile robots. The first task covered was robot reactive behaviors, such as aggression, fear, love, and curiosity based on the detection of the targeted object using Alex Net. The second task implemented was making the robot follow a specific person and collision avoidance.
